To start the project you just need to first install all the requirements that include streamlit, pandas, sentence_transformer and torch.
If the requirements are satisfied start the program using: streamlit run ap.py

To make the program more efficient use new text data inside the dataset.csv file including both plagiarized(1) and not plagiarized(2) texts.
